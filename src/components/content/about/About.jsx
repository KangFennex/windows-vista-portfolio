    I'm Michel, a passionate and driven self-taught developer based in Manchester, UK. I'm an academically-trained historian, but I now work with a variety of frontend and analytical languages, responsive frameworks, and database management systems. I'm most comfortable working with React and the MERN stack. I'm currently building a web platform for event planning, mixing both corporate and private events, with a strong focus on social sharing and a client-side calendar-based planning. When I'm not on my computer or exploring the city, I practice languages or read history.
